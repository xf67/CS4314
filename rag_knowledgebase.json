Extensive research has delineated the complex role of DPEP1 in oncogenesis and tumor progression, with its influence being context dependent. DPEP1 has been observed to promote oncogenic activities in hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and lymphoblastic malignancies and is hypothesized to participate in multiple biological processes, including tumor cell invasion, metastatic spread, cellular signaling pathways, cell-matrix interactions, and evasion of immune surveillance.

It is worth emphasizing that climate issues are taking a larger place in the school curriculum for youth in elementary, middle and high schools. Youth are thus increasingly aware of the major threat and understandably report legitimate concerns and worries. For some youth, eco-anxiety leads to greater involvement and activism, as can be seen by the international movement set out and led by youth activist Greta Thunberg. However, eco-anxiety can also lead to feelings of hopelessness and disengagement.

Mapping the epidemiology of RHD involves elucidating its geographic distribution, temporal trends, and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of RHD in Africa varies widely, with estimates ranging from 2.9 to 30.4 per 1,000 population. Factors contributing to this burden include limited access to health care, poverty, lack of research interest, and genetic fragility. Studies have highlighted differences in group A Streptococcus (GAS) incidence among different African countries, emphasizing the importance of effective monitoring and intervention strategies. RHD epidemiological mapping in Africa indicates regional differences and socioeconomic determinants. The high prevalence among females in most studies and among children underscores the urgency for targeted interventions. Diagnosing RHD in Africa faces challenges of inaccessibility of health facilities and trained personnel. Efforts to develop cost-effective and accessible diagnostic tools, such as mobile/portable echocardiography machines, molecular biomarkers such as Tenascin-C and microRNA expression profile shows promise for accurate diagnosis of RHD, but their validation and utilization is limited due to resource constraints. Furthermore, lack of an effective licensed vaccine for GAS causes significant retardation in RHD control in Africa. Addressing the burden of RHD in Africa and other low- and middle-income countries requires robust RHD biomarkers and effective vaccines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the landscape of RHD in Africa, covering the bacteriology of GAS, the burden of GAS infections, exploring diagnostic avenues, challenges, and opportunities in RHD biomarkers, diagnosis, effective prevention strategies, and RHD management in Africa.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "10", "day": "30"}}, {"article_title": "Light-Triggered Reversible Assembly of Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets.", "article_abstract": "Advancements in stimuli-driven nanoactuators necessitate the discovery of photo-switchable, self-contained semiconductor nanostructures capable of precise mechanical responses. The reversible assembly of 0D Cs<sub>3</sub>Bi<sub>2</sub>I<sub>9</sub> halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) between stacked and scattered configurations are demonstrated under light and dark, respectively. This sunlight-triggered perpetual flipping of the NPLs, occurring in less than a minute, is associated with a color change between brown and red. The photomechanical response is driven by the formation and cleavage of sulfide linkages at the NPL surface. In the stacked configuration, various stacking modes create moir\u00e9 superstructures, enhancing the interlayer charge distribution, and increasing the electronic conductivity and optical absorbance. This leads to a decrease in exciton binding energy from 247 meV for scattered NPLs to 162 meV for stacked NPLs, resulting in a 3.5-fold enhancement in dark current for the stacked NPL films. The switchable control over color and electric current is continuously reversible and retraceable, exhibiting a minor memory effect observed during extended cycling. The self-flipping NPL nanoactuators demonstrate reversible mechanical responses, with topographical oscillations ranging from 14 nm in scattered NPLs to 50 nm in the vertically stacked configuration.

Recent drug development efforts have significantly focused on the modulation of P2X receptors. Here, we investigated the effects of the synthetic LPS-neutralizing peptide Pep19-2.5 on human P2X receptors in cells of the innate immune system. Pep19-2.5 concentration-dependently triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in Toll-like receptor-stimulated human macrophages and monocytes.

In the event, restrictions did not change, and deaths peaked at 202, well below the lower bound, even though this spanned one order of magnitude.

Environmental surveillance has been employed effectively in this regard to measure and track infectious diseases such as polio on a population-wide scale. In this study, environmental surveillance was used as a cost-effective tool for the detection of soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) in Accra, Ghana, in an area that is populated by urban vegetable farmers. The activities of urban farmers expose them to the risk of STH infection, as well as impact the transmission in urban areas since leafy vegetables could carry infective stages of STHs. A total of 32 wastewater samples were collected from eight points on the Nima Creek (the main source of irrigation for the farmers) over a 7-week period. Real-time PCR and melt peak analysis were used to screen four STHs (i.e., <i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, <i>Necator americanus</i>, <i>Ancylostoma duodenale</i>, and <i>Trichuris trichiura</i>). This study revealed that <i>A. lumbricoides</i> (17 out of 32 wastewater samples, 53.3%) was the most prevalent STH, followed by <i>A. duodenale</i> (31.2%), <i>T. trichiura</i> (21.9%), and <i>N. americanus</i> (12.5%).

High genetic diversity may allow for this habitat flexibility, but the specific genes underlying switches between habitats are poorly understood. One lineage of <i>Acinetobacter</i> has undergone a substantial habitat change by evolving from a presumed soil-dwelling ancestral state to thrive in floral nectar. Here, we compared the genomes of floral-dwelling and pollinator-associated <i>Acinetobacter</i>, including newly described species, with genomes from relatives found in other environments to determine the genomic changes associated with this ecological shift. Following one evolutionary origin of floral nectar adaptation, nectar-dwelling <i>Acinetobacter</i> taxa have undergone reduction in genome size compared with relatives and have experienced dynamic gene gains and losses as they diversified. Gene content changes suggest a shift to metabolism of monosaccharides rather than diverse carbohydrates, and scavenging of nitrogen sources, which we predict to be beneficial in nectar environments. Gene gains appear to result from duplication events, evolutionary divergence, and horizontal gene transfer. Most notably, nectar-dwelling <i>Acinetobacter</i> acquired the ability to degrade pectin from plant pathogens, and the genes underlying this ability have duplicated and are under selection within the clade. We hypothesize that this ability was a key trait for adaptation to floral nectar, as it could improve access to nutrients in the nutritionally unbalanced habitat of nectar.

Previous studies have typically examined extracted bone sections, which may not directly correlate with outcomes in human hip systems. This study aimed to evaluate bone density changes resulting from broaching and uncemented implantation using micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) on cadaveric samples. An in-house density calibration phantom (DCP) was developed by validating the densities of polymer inserts through mass and volume measurements. Its performance was then evaluated using lamb bone in comparison with a commercial DCP (QRM-50124). The sensitivity of density predictions to \u03bcCT scan parameters was also evaluated with the lamb bone. Additionally, density predictions from medical-CT and \u03bcCT scans were compared using the in-house DCP. Finally, uncemented THA procedures were performed on three cadaveric femurs, each undergoing three \u03bcCT scans at various surgical stages to assess changes in bone density. The density predictions obtained using the in-house DCP achieved an accuracy of \u00b10.097\u2009g/cc compared to QRM-50124, with a precision of \u00b10.052\u2009g/cc. The sensitivity to changes in \u03bcCT scan parameters was \u00b10.022\u2009g/cc. Notably, density predictions from medical-CT and \u03bcCT scans were similar, particularly in cortical bone. Broaching and implantation led to an average increase in bone density of 0.137\u2009g/cc, which was attributed to the accumulation of bone debris around the bone-implant interface. This accumulation raised the bone volume fraction, ranging from 3.31% to 20.69%, which acts as an autograft. These measurements have been made for the first time using a \u00b5CT and an in-house DCP.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "26"}}, {"article_title": "Etiology and Phenotypes of Cardiomyopathy in Southern Africa: The IMHOTEP Multicenter Pilot Study.", "article_abstract": "Cardiomyopathies are an important cause of heart failure in Africa yet there are limited data on etiology and clinical phenotypes.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "05", "day": "08"}}, {"article_title": "The Impact of Immune Cells, Metabolites, Inflammatory Factors, and Circulating Proteins on Atopic Dermatitis: Insights from a Mendelian Randomization Study.", "article_abstract": "The onset of atopic dermatitis (AD) is complex, and its specific pathological mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Effect of axial elongation on anterior scleral thickness in myopia.", "article_abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of axial elongation on anterior scleral thickness (AST) in myopia.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "23"}}, {"article_title": "Self-Assembly of Human Fibrinogen into Microclot-Mimicking Antifibrinolytic Amyloid Fibrinogen Particles.", "article_abstract": "Recent clinical studies have highlighted the presence of microclots in the form of amyloid fibrinogen particles (AFPs) in plasma samples from Long COVID patients. However, the clinical significance of these abnormal, nonfibrillar self-assembly aggregates of human fibrinogen remains debated due to the limited understanding of their structural and biological characteristics. In this study, we present a method for generating mimetic microclots in vitro. Using this approach, the self-assembly process, structural organization of AFPs, and their interactions with human plasma components were elucidated. The amyloid transition of fibrinogen occurs under acidic conditions within a pH range of 2.3-3.2. Well-dispersed amyloid oligomers of fibrinogen, ranging in size from 1 to 5 \u03bcm, can be prepared at pH 2.8 after 1 h of incubation. We tracked the dynamic self-assembly process at the single-molecule level using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). The arrangement of amyloid oligomers manifests as well-ordered, stacked nanodomains with striped patterns, growing perpendicular to the primary axis of the fibrinogen monomer. Upon transfer to physiological solution conditions or human plasma, these amyloid oligomers further aggregate into nonfibrillar structures at the micrometer scale, resembling the microclots observed in the bloodstream of Long COVID patients. Notably, these AFPs exhibit characteristics consistent with microclots, including positive staining in thioflavin T (ThT) assays and resistance to fibrinolysis. Proteomic analysis suggests that AFPs interact with various components of human plasma and have an enhanced binding affinity with complement C3 compared to native fibrinogen.

This study compares the effectiveness and accuracy of traditional drilling guides with two AR-based navigation techniques: one utilizing ArUco markers and the other employing small-workspace infrared tracking cameras for a drilling task. Additionally, an alternative AR visualization paradigm for surgical navigation is proposed that eliminates the potential inaccuracies of image detection using headset cameras. Through a series of controlled experiments designed to assess the accuracy of hole placements in surgical scenarios, the performance of each method was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings reveal that the small-workspace infrared tracking camera system is on par with the accuracy of conventional drilling guides, hinting at a promising future where such guides could become obsolete. This technology demonstrates a substantial advantage by circumventing the common issues encountered with traditional tracking systems and surpassing the accuracy of ArUco marker-based navigation. These results underline the potential of this system for enabling more minimally invasive interventions, a crucial step towards enhancing surgical accuracy and, ultimately, patient outcomes. The study resulted in three relevant contributions: first, a new paradigm for AR visualization in the operating room, relying only on exact tracking information to navigate the surgeon is proposed.

APTO253 is a small molecule that selectively kills acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, and it has been reported that APTO253 can induce Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression and downregulate c-MYC expression. Recently, we discovered a novel role of APTO253 in modulating the NK cell response by inducing surface expression of NKG2D-Ls, especially MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA), in AML cells. In this study, we extended the research to validate the effect of APTO253 in other cancer cell lines and found that the enhanced expression of NKG2D-Ls in response to APTO253 is limited in a tumor cell-specific manner.

Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant potential in the analysis of rs-fMRI. However, accurately distinguishing between healthy control group and ASD has been a longstanding challenge. In this regard, this work proposes a model featuring a dual-path cross-attention framework for spatial and temporal patterns, named STDCformer, aiming to enhance the accuracy of ASD identification. STDCformer can preserve both temporal-specific patterns and spatial-specific patterns while explicitly interacting spatiotemporal information in depth. The embedding layer of the STDCformer embeds temporal and spatial patterns in dual paths. For the temporal path, we introduce a perturbation positional encoding to improve the issue of signal misalignment caused by individual differences. For the spatial path, we propose a correlation metric based on Gramian angular field similarity to establish a more specific whole-brain functional network. Subsequently, we interleave the query and key vectors of dual paths to interact spatial and temporal information. We further propose integrating the dual-path attention into a tensor that retains spatiotemporal dimensions and utilizing 2D convolution for feed-forward processing. Our attention layer allows the model to represent spatiotemporal correlations of signals at multiple scales to alleviate issues of information distortion and loss. Our STDCformer demonstrates competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on the ABIDE dataset.

While providing valuable products, and despite Best Available Techniques (BAT) being used, managing wastewater effectively remains a key area for developing technologies and alternatives for environmental protection. Activated sludge (AS) systems are commonly used for effluent treatment, where microorganisms composition influences reactor efficiency. Current monitoring strategies show limited correlation with chemical parameters. Metabarcoding, a DNA sequencing approach, offers a promising alternative to profile microbial communities comprehensively. Utilizing MinION and Illumina sequencing, this study reveals the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial communities in AS from an extended aeration-activated sludge reactor from a pulp mill for the first time. Eukaryotic composition evaluated by 18S amplicon sequencing revealed Protists as the dominant group, followed by Animalia and Fungi. Within these groups, the most abundant phyla detected were Ciliophora (75\u00a0% on average), Rotifera (90\u00a0% on average), and Cryptomycota (60\u00a0% on average), respectively. Genera like Prorodon and Limnias stand out due to their high relative abundance within the Protist and Animalia group, respectively. A comparative analysis with routine microorganism composition assessment by microscopy revealed consistent taxonomic trends, affirming the feasibility of amplicon sequencing for routine microbial community surveillance. Furthermore, the incorporation of metabarcoding enhanced the depth of results. Prokaryotic composition analyzed by 16S amplicon sequencing revealed microorganisms previously described as relevant to the wastewater treatment process but highlighted dominant specific groups even when compared to other pulp facilities. Genera like Terrimonas, Defluviicoccus, and Methylocaldum appear as the most abundant among the identified genera. For proper reactor operation, microorganisms must aggregate around organic matter in flocs, which reflect reactor health and are composed of 5\u00a0% eukaryotes and 95\u00a0% prokaryotes. Hence, the characterization of both groups of microorganisms is crucial. Differences in communities between the wastewater treatment plant's aeration zones emphasize the importance of comprehensive community characterization. The study underscores metabarcoding's potential as a monitoring tool, for future linking of microbial communities with process patterns for improved environmental management in the pulp and paper industry and emphasizes the importance of establishing unique baselines for microbial communities in activated sludge systems.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "07", "day": "05"}}, {"article_title": "Nutritional Value Addition of Bread, Pasta, and Noodles by Incorporating Leaves of Moringa oleifera.", "article_abstract": "The growing demand for natural, health-promoting food products has led to increased interest in integrating nutrient-rich ingredients into everyday foods.

Two noncanonical rNTRs that are thought to be poly(A) polymerases (PAPs) have been identified in the mitochondria of trypanosomes - KPAP1 and KPAP2. KPAP1 is the primary polymerase that adds adenines (As) to trypanosome mitochondrial mRNA 3<sup>'</sup> tails, while KPAP2 is a non-essential putative polymerase whose role in the mitochondria is ambiguous. Here, we elucidate the effects of manipulations of KPAP1 and KPAP2 on the 5<sup>'</sup> and 3<sup>'</sup> termini of transcripts and their 3<sup>'</sup> tails. Using glycerol gradients followed by immunoblotting, we present evidence that KPAP2 is found in protein complexes of up to about 1600 kDa.

Our study reveals the influence of partially restricting the mobility of the infected population, who are allowed to diffuse locally and can be modeled using random dispersion. In contrast, the non-infective population, which includes susceptible and recovered individuals, has more freedom in their movements. This greater mobility can be modeled using nonlocal dispersion. Our approach is valid for a class of nonlocal dispersion kernels. For the analysis, we first establish the well-posedness of the solution, ensuring the existence, uniqueness, and positivity of this solution. Additionally, we identify the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> with its threshold role. Specifically, when R<sub>0</sub>\u00a0<\u00a01, we prove the global asymptotic stability of the disease-free steady state. Conversely, when R<sub>0</sub>\u00a0>\u00a01, we demonstrate the corresponding semiflow of the model is uniformly persistent and establish behavior at endemic steady state. Lastly, we examine the asymptotic profiles of the positive steady state as the rate at which susceptible or infected individuals disperse tends to zero or infinity.

So the current production mode is featured by single well tank oil storage, oil tank truck transportation and manual tank truck scheduling. At present, oil well production and crude oil transportation scheduling mainly rely on manual formulation, which has poor coordination and seriously restricts the release of oil well production capacity and the reduction of transportation cost. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model representation was proposed in our previous work. The scale of the built model variables is huge, and the model solution time is long. In this paper, a genetic algorithm based on multi-layer coding is proposed. The first layer of the design code is the driving path of the oil tanker, and the second layer is the crude oil loading and unloading amount and the cumulative time. The algorithm expands the search domain by flipping, exchanging and shifting the code. In the case analysis part, the exact algorithm and the genetic algorithm designed in this paper are used to solve cases of different scales (5, 10, 30 and 200 oil wells) respectively, and the correctness and effectiveness of the algorithm are verified. The results show that, compared with the exact algorithm, the genetic algorithm designed in this paper can quickly solve a feasible scheduling scheme under different oil well scales, especially in the case of large-scale (200 wells) oil well groups.

In addition to being the primary food source during early infancy, human milk also provides multiple bioactive components that shape the infant gut microbiome and immune system and provides a constant source of exposure to maternal microbiota. Given the potential interplay between allergic diseases and the human microbiome, this study aimed to characterise the milk microbiome of allergic mothers. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on milk samples collected at 3 and 6\u2009months postpartum from 196 women with allergic disease. Multivariate linear mixed models were constructed to identify the maternal, infant, and environmental determinants of the milk microbiome. Human milk microbiome composition and beta diversity varied over time (PERMANOVA R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.011, p\u2009=\u20090.011). The season of infant birth emerged as the strongest determinant of the microbiome community structure (PERMANOVA R<sup>2</sup>\u2009=\u20090.014, p\u2009=\u20090.011) with impacts on five of the most abundant taxa. The milk microbiome also varied according to the type of maternal allergic disease (allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy). Additionally, infant formula exposure reduced the relative abundance of several typical oral taxa in milk. In conclusion, the milk microbiome of allergic mothers was strongly shaped by the season of infant birth, maternal allergic disease phenotype, and infant feeding mode. Maternal allergic disease history and infant season of birth should therefore be considered in future studies of infant and maternal microbiota.

During this study, we measured changes in smoke composition and physical properties due to oxidative aging and exposure to humidity. We found that smoke aging led to SOA formation and increases in ratios of organic carbon to elemental carbon. Aerosol liquid water content increased with increasing relative humidity (RH), and aged smoke took up more water than fresh smoke at all humidity levels, likely due to a combination of changes in aerosol surface polarity at low and medium RH and increases in surface area with aging at high RH. Growth factors ranged from 1.06 \u00b1 0.08 for fresh smoke at low RH to 1.32 \u00b1 0.08 for aged smoke at high RH. Oxidative aging and exposure to humidity led to increases in \u03c1<sub>eff</sub>.

Though the composition and metabolism of these bacteria are well described in both healthy hosts and those with intestinal disease, less is known about the metabolic activity of the gut bacteria prior to, and during, disease development-especially regarding gut bacterial replication. Here, we use a recently developed single-cell technique alongside existing metagenomics-based tools to identify, track, and quantify replicating gut bacteria both <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in situ</i> in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) mouse model of colitis. We show that the proportion of replicating gut bacteria decreases when mice have the highest levels of inflammation and returns to baseline levels as mice begin recovering. In addition, we report significant alterations in the composition of the replicating gut bacterial community <i>ex vivo</i> during colitis development. On the taxa level, we observe significant changes in the abundance of taxa such as the mucus-degrading <i>Akkermansia</i> and the poorly described <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> genus. We further demonstrate that many taxa exhibit variable replication rates <i>in situ</i> during colitis, including <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>. Lastly, we show that colitis development is positively correlated with increases in the presence and abundance of bacteria <i>in situ</i> which are predicted to be fast replicators. This could suggest that taxa with the potential to replicate quickly may have an advantage during intestinal inflammation. These data support the need for additional research using activity-based approaches to further characterize the gut bacterial response to intestinal inflammation and its consequences for both the host and the gut microbial community.IMPORTANCEIt is well known that the bacteria living inside the gut are important for human health. Indeed, the type of bacteria that are present and their metabolism are different in healthy people versus those with intestinal disease. However, less is known about how these gut bacteria are replicating, especially as someone begins to develop intestinal disease. This is particularly important as it is thought that metabolically active gut bacteria may be more relevant to health.

Although the alkane monooxygenase AlmA plays a critical role in the metabolic pathway of solid long-chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (\u2265C<sub>20</sub>) that are extremely difficult to degrade, the mechanism regulating this process remains unclear. Here, we characterized the function of AlmA in <i>Acinetobacter venetianus</i> RAG-1, which was mainly involved in the degradation of long-chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (C<sub>26</sub>-C<sub>38</sub>), among which, <i>n</i>-C<sub>32</sub> induced the <i>almA</i> promoter activity most. APR1 (<u>A</u>lmA <u>P</u>ositive <u>R</u>egulator) that it is an AraC/XylS-type transcription regulator, a potential transcriptional regulator of <i>almA</i>, was screened by DNA-pull down, which was determined by conserved domain analysis. The deletion of <i>apR1</i> severely reduced the capacity of strain RAG-1 to utilize long-chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (C<sub>22</sub>-C<sub>38</sub>), indicating the involvement of APR1 in <i>n</i>-alkanes degradation. The results of the APR1-dependent reporter system, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and microscale thermophoresis further proved that APR1 was able to directly bind to the <i>almA</i> promoter region, thus activating the <i>almA</i> transcription. Furthermore, APR1 could inhibit self-expression through autoregulation in the absence of long-chain <i>n</i>-alkanes. <i>n</i>-C<sub>32</sub> acted as a ligand of APR1, and the amino acid residues Val10, Gln50, Ala99, and Ile106 at the N-terminus of APR1 were necessary for binding <i>n</i>-C<sub>32</sub>. In addition, the key amino acid residues of APR1 within the C-terminal helix-turn-helix motif that bound to the downstream promoter region were confirmed by multiple sequence alignment and site-directed mutagenesis.

This prospective, pilot study screened all patients requiring a primary elective or emergency lumbar discectomy, under the supervision of a single consultant neurosurgeon, over an 8-month period at a single neurosurgical unit.

As sequencing data become more readily available, there is a growing need for detecting cancer driver genes based on statistical and mathematical modeling methods. Currently, plenty of driver gene identification algorithms have been published, but they fail to achieve consistent results. In order to obtain gene sets with high confidence, we present DriverDetector, an R package providing a convenient workflow for cancer driver genes detection and downstream analysis. We develop the background mutation rate calculating module based on the distance between genes in covariate space and binomial test, followed by the driver gene selection module which integrates 11 methods, including two already recognized approaches, a de novo method, and five variants of Fisher's method which are applied to driver gene identification for the first time. Through verification on 12 TCGA datasets, each method is able to identify a set of confirmed driver genes while the number of resulting genes vary significantly across different methods. For robust driver genes detection, a voting strategy based on 10 of the statistical methods is further applied. Results show that the collective prediction based on the voting strategy demonstrates superiority in achieving the consistency of prediction while ensuring a reasonable number of predicted genes and confirmed drivers. By comparing the results of each cancer dataset, we also find that sample size has a huge impact on the number of predicted genes. For downstream analysis, DriverDetector automatically generates plenty of plots and tables to elaborate the results. We propose DriverDetector as a user-friendly tool promoting early diagnosis of cancer and the development of targeted drugs.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "07", "day": "01"}}, {"article_title": "Clinical and pathological characteristics of HR+ breast cancer with HER2 low and HER2(0) expression: exploring endocrine therapy sensitivity.", "article_abstract": "The clinical significance of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) low and HER2(0) expression in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer patients remains uncertain.

The PGDMF system consistently met the design flow and regulated water quality/performance parameters (i.e., total coliform, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, turbidity, and membrane integrity). The instantaneous temperature-corrected permeability (TCP) varied seasonally, being greater during the winter months. The overall TCP decreased slowly to \u223c60% of the initial value by the end of 3 years, a TCP that is much greater than would have been expected without passive hydraulic fouling control. Although it was not possible to directly link the observed seasonal changes in TCP to potential seasonal changes in the biofilm microbiome, the analysis did suggest that the lower TCP during summer months was due to a greater microorganism richness in the feed and presence of filamentous, stalked, and biofilm-forming bacteria in the biofilm. Operation with higher trans-membrane pressure (i.e., \u223c30 vs \u223c20 mbar) and more frequent passive hydraulic fouling control (i.e., every 12 vs 24 h) enabled a greater flow to be sustained.

Despite the aggressive nature and poor prognosis associated with these tumors, which have a median survival time of approximately 4-7 months, no standardized treatment guidelines are currently established. There are currently no reported cases of extended progression-free survival (PFS) in SMARCA4-UT patients treated with surgery and immunotherapy. Here, we report the clinical features and genomic information of a SMARCA4-UT case in which the patient responded significantly to a combination therapy involving surgery, immunotherapy, and amlotinib. A 56-year-old male non-smoker presented with a mass in the superior lobe of left lung and left hilar adenopathy. A left upper lobectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed, and postoperative pathology confirmed that the tumor was Thoracic SMARCA4-UT.

However, the limited available of electron acceptors with adequate solubility and favorable molecular packing presents a challenge in achieving efficient non-halogenated solvent-processed OSCs. Herein, inspired by the three-dimensional dimeric acceptor CH8-4, we employed a molecular isomerization strategy to synthesize its isomers, CH8-4A and CH8-4B, by tuning the position of fluorine (F) atom in the central unit. The differing intramolecular fluorine-sulfur non-covalent interactions among these isomers led to differences in molecular pre-aggregation abilities (CH8-4B<CH8-4<CH8-4A) in o-xylene (o-XY) solution, which significantly influence the film-forming process and the resultant morphological characteristics. Among these, the blend film of CH8-4, characterized by moderate molecular pre-aggregation, achieved optimal bi-continuous donor/acceptor phase separation. Consequently, the o-xylene processed PM6\u2009:\u2009CH8-4 device achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.1\u2009%, outperforming that of two other devices.

For example, not all models respect fundamental conservation laws such as conservation of atoms in an interconnected chemical system. In well performing models, these unphysical deviations are often ignored because they are frequently minor, and thus only need a small nudge to perfectly conserve mass. Here we introduce a method that anchors a prediction from any numerical model to physically consistent hard constraints, nudging concentrations to the nearest solution that respects the conservation laws. This closed-form model-agnostic correction uses a single matrix operation to minimally perturb the predicted concentrations to ensure that atoms are conserved to machine precision. To demonstrate this approach, we train a gradient boosting decision tree ensemble to emulate a small reference model of ozone photochemistry and test the effect of the correction on accurate but nonconservative predictions. The nudging approach minimally perturbs the already well-predicted results for most species, but decreases the accuracy of important oxidants, including radicals. We develop a weighted extension of this nudging approach that considers the uncertainty and magnitude of each species in the correction. This species-level weighting approach is essential to accurately predict important low concentration species such as radicals. We find that applying the species-weighted correction slightly improves overall accuracy by nudging unphysical predictions to a more likely mass-conserving solution.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "11", "day": "20"}}, {"article_title": "Robert Bernasconi and the challenges of a Critical Philosophy of Race: (Un)learning to read and teach the history of moral philosophy.", "article_abstract": "This essay is an attempt to determine what Robert Bernasconi's body of work in Critical Philosophy of Race can teach us about the way in which we, philosophers and professors of philosophy, ought to treat our institutional heritage. What should we make, for instance, of moral claims made by philosophers of the modern era who - tacitly or explicitly - manifested certain levels of endorsement toward the Atlantic Slave Trade? How should we comprehend the conceptual tools that we have inherited from them, knowing that those were formulated alongside justificatory claims for the enslavement of Africans - claims that we now deem undoubtably and universally immoral? I extract from Bernasconi's writings an implicit methodology that can be broken down into three main moves: (1) a historiographical work, akin to Michel Foucault's 'archaeological' method, aimed at uncovering the material conditions that allowed for the emergence of philosophical ideas of the past, (2) a dialectical work aimed at interpreting this collection of historical data through the critical lens of race, and (3) a pedagogical work aimed at transforming the practice of academic philosophy in light of the critique. I conclude that his methodological contribution culminates in an invitation to revisit and transform the past of the institution by treating the history of academic philosophy as philosophically and conceptually relevant rather than merely incidental. Such a commitment toward critically engaging the past of our institution urges us to revisit the canon in specific ways.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "09", "day": "16"}}, {"article_title": "A Qualitative Exploration on the Role of Occupational Therapy in Mental Health and Psychosocial Support for Students in the University Setting in the Philippines.", "article_abstract": "Occupational therapy (OT) can be part of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in the university setting.

The protozoan responsible for human amoebiasis, <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>, exhibits an active membrane movement and voracious phagocytosis, events in which the retromer may be fully involved. In this work, we studied the structure of EhVps35 the central member of the CSC retromeric subcomplex as it binds EhVps26 and EhVps29, the other two CSC members, allowing the position of the retromer in the membranes. We also studied the EhVps35 role in the recycling of virulence proteins, particularly those involved in phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy assays revealed that EhVps35 is located in the plasmatic and endosomal membranes and in the phagocytic cups and channels. In addition, it follows the target cell from the moment it is in contact with the trophozoites. Molecular docking analyses, immunoprecipitation assays, and microscopy studies revealed that EhVps35 interacts with the EhADH, Gal/GalNac lectin, and actin proteins. In addition, experimental evidence indicated that it recycles surface proteins, particularly EhADH and Gal/GalNac proteins, two molecules highly involved in virulence. Knockdown of the <i>Ehvps35</i> gene induced a decrease in protein recycling, as well as impairments in the efficiency of adhesion and the rate of phagocytosis.

We show how the interference is due to the presence of copper ions from the filters and propose a mechanism for how it interferes with the assay, accounting for differences between the different versions of the Griess assay used in each sensor, and discuss strategies for its management.

However, the underlying mechanisms by which these disorders aggravate outcomes are not yet clear limiting the therapeutic opportunities. To fill this gap, we characterized, for the first time, the effects of T2D and obesity on the brain repair mechanisms occurring 7 days after stroke, notably glial scarring. In the present study, by performing a 30-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on db/db (obese diabetics mice) and db/+\u202f(controls) mice, we demonstrated that obese and diabetic mice displayed larger lesions (i.e. increased infarct volume, ischemic core, apoptotic cell number) and worsened neurological outcomes compared to their control littermates. We then investigated the formation of the glial scar in control and db/db mice 7 days post-stroke. Our observations argue in favor of a stronger and more persistent activation of astrocytes and microglia in db/db mice. Furthermore, an increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) was observed in db/db vs control mice (i.e. chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan and collagen type IV). Consequently, we demonstrated for the first time that the db/db status is associated with increased astrocytic and microglial activation 7 days after stroke and resulted in higher deposition of ECM within the damaged area. Interestingly, the injury-induced neurogenesis appeared stronger in db/db as shown by the labeling of migrating neuroblast. This increase appeared correlated to the larger size of lesion.

There are no approved pharmacologic therapies for CMT1X, and identifying new treatments that slow the onset and severity of neuromuscular decline may aid disease management. Cemdomespib is an orally bioavailable small molecule that improved demyelination and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphology in mice lacking Cx32 expression. However, whether a similar efficacy may manifest in models of CMT1X arising from Cx32 mutations that cause the organellar accumulation of the protein was unclear. Additionally, it was unclear whether cemdomespib therapy slowed the rate of demyelination/NMJ degeneration or stabilized nerve and NMJ morphology to levels present at the initiation of drug therapy. To address these issues, 4-month-old R75W-Cx32 mice, which accumulate the mutant Cx32 in golgi, were treated for 0, 10, or 20 weeks with 0 or 3 mg/kg cemdomespib. Grip strength, motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), femoral nerve myelination, and NMJ morphology were quantified.

One of the most important prerequisites for combating emerging diseases is the development of vaccines within a short period of time. In this study, antigen-irradiated, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses and the disaccharide trehalose were used to enhance immune responses in the Syrian hamster. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was isolated from tracheal swabs, confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and propagated on Vero cells. For inactivation, it was irradiated with 14.00 kGy gamma radiation. Evaluation of the antigenic properties of the spike protein subunit S1 showed that the antigens were intact after gamma irradiation. The gamma-irradiated and formalin-treated viruses were used to immunize hamsters in four vaccine formulations. Neutralizing antibodies increased significantly in all vaccinated groups three weeks after the second and third vaccinations. The concentration of secretory immunoglobulin A in the irradiated vaccine plus trehalose increased significantly in nasal lavage and nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoid tissue fluids three weeks after the second and third vaccinations. The lymphocyte proliferation test in the spleen showed a significant increase in all vaccinated hamsters, but the increase was greater in irradiated vaccine plus trehalose and irradiated vaccine plus alum. We can recommend the irradiated inactivated vaccine SARS-CoV-2 plus trehalose (intra-nasal) and another irradiated inactivated vaccine SARS-CoV-2 plus alum (subcutaneous) as safe vaccines against coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), which can stimulate mucosal, humeral, and cellular immunities.

However, the link between SERCA2b and neuroinflammation in epilepsy remains undetermined. This study aimed to establish the relationship between SERCA2b, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in epilepsy to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism in epileptogenesis. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress were induced in N2a cells using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). However, experimental temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was induced in mice using pilocarpine. Further, effects of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation on SERCA2b and ER stress markers were assessed at protein and mRNA levels. Calcium imaging was employed to determine intracellular calcium levels. SERCA2b expression significantly decreased after LPS, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and pilocarpine exposure at both mRNA and protein levels, mediated by upregulating neuroinflammation. This downregulation of SERCA2b was associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species and elevated intracellular calcium levels, leading to elevated ER stress markers.

Previous research has primarily focused on upper-grade elementary students, with relatively less attention given to younger age groups, resulting in insufficient representativeness of the elementary student samples. Additionally, research exploring how parental addictive behaviors are associated with the mechanisms of internet addiction among elementary students has been limited, which affects the development of scientifically based and effective intervention measures for addressing internet addiction in this population. This study, grounded in Family Systems Theory, explores the associative mechanisms between parental smartphone dependence and elementary students' internet addiction, specifically examining the mediating role of parent-child conflict and the moderating role of parental roles. Using a convenience sampling method, questionnaires were administered to parents from two elementary schools, resulting in 433 valid responses. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that parental smartphone dependence is associated with elementary students' internet addiction and that this association is further influenced by the mediating role of parent-child conflict. Additionally, parental roles moderate the relationships between parental smartphone dependence and parent-child conflict, as well as between parent-child conflict and elementary students' internet addiction. Compared to mothers, fathers' smartphone dependence is more significantly correlated with parent-child conflict, and conflicts initiated by fathers are more strongly associated with elementary students' internet addiction. This may be related to China's traditional \"male breadwinner, female homemaker\" family culture. Mothers typically assume more parenting responsibilities and establish closer emotional bonds with their children, serving as a protective factor against internet addiction. Therefore, it is recommended that parents reduce smartphone dependence to avoid parent-child conflicts, and that fathers increase their involvement in parenting activities to build stronger emotional connections with their children, thereby fostering healthier internet use behaviors among elementary students.

However, due to the failure of previous single target-centric treatments to effectively address these two limiting steps in controlling the inflammatory storm, no available therapies are approved for ARDS treatment. Herein, inspired by spontaneous inflammation resolution, two kinds of Apoptosis and Efferocytosis Restored Nanoparticles (AER NPs) are proposed to overcome these two limiting steps for counteracting severe inflammatory storm. For the first limiting step, neutrophil-targeted apoptosis-restored nanoparticles (AR NPs) accelerated the programmed apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils. The resolution of the first limiting step facilitated the accumulation of macrophage-targeted and efferocytosis-restored nanoparticles (ER NPs), thereby restoring macrophage efferocytosis and alleviating the second limiting step. The results indicated that after sequential treatment with AER NPs, recruited neutrophils decreased to 13.86%, and macrophage efferocytosis increased to 563.24%.

While the impact of infections caused by various microbes and host effector molecules in pulpal and periapical diseases is widely recognized, disease susceptibility and progression are also influenced by the dynamic interaction between host genetic factors and environmental influences. Apical periodontitis occurs as an inflammatory response to microorganisms present in the root canals of infected teeth. Initially functioning as the body's defense mechanism, this response often progresses to chronic inflammation. Several studies have established associations between genetic polymorphisms and various dental conditions, including temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders, dental caries, orthognathic surgeries, open bite malocclusion, periapical periodontitis, pulp stones, pulpitis, periapical abscesses, local anesthesia complications, and endodontic treatment outcomes. Key findings from this review highlight the role of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1, MMP2, MMP3, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which influence inflammatory pathways and tissue remodeling. For example, SNPs in interleukin genes, such as IL-1\u03b2 (-511 C/T), have been linked to an increased risk of apical periodontitis, while MMP gene polymorphisms contribute to tissue degradation in periapical lesions. This review underscores the importance of identifying genetic markers that drive disease progression and inflammatory processes in pulpal and periapical pathologies.

One key remaining challenge is identifying solid electrolytes that combine high ionic conductivity with stability in contact with the highly reducing potentials of next-generation anodes. Fully reduced electrolytes, based on irreducible anions, offer a promising solution by avoiding electrolyte decomposition altogether. In this study, we demonstrate the compositional flexibility of the disordered antifluorite framework accessible by mechanochemical synthesis and leverage it to discover irreducible electrolytes with high ionic conductivities.

Methods for blight management in pomegranate production are scarce and not well established. To date, the major control strategy is targeting the pathogen with antibiotics and copper-based compounds. However, excessive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic resistance in the field population of Xcp. Hence, as a means of eco-friendly and sustainable management of bacterial blight, the use of native endophytes was investigated under field conditions in the current study. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from micro-propagated nodal explants of pomegranate and were identified as <i>Bacillus haynesii</i>, <i>B. tequilensis</i>, and <i>B. subtilis</i>.

Then, using amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the impact of PV panels on soil microbial diversity and function, focusing specifically on the assembly processes and co-occurrence networks of bacterial and fungal communities. Our results indicate that the installation of PV panels improved soil conditions, leading to concurrent effects on microbial community structure and function. This process appears to be deterministic, driven primarily by homogeneous selection. Notably, PV panels increased the complexity of bacterial networks while decreasing their stability. In contrast, PV panels did not affect the complexity of fungal networks despite their stability increased. These findings provide new evidence that soil bacterial networks are more sensitive to PV panels installation than fungal networks, deepening our understanding of land-use change effects on soil ecosystem functions.

Compared with planktons, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the ecological differences between abundant and rare taxa in benthic bacteria along a large river. Here, we offer comprehensive insights into the spatiotemporal distributions, co-occurrence networks, and assembly processes of three divided categories namely always rare taxa (ART), conditionally rare taxa (CRT), and conditionally rare and abundant taxa (CRAT) in sediments covering a distance of 4,300\u202fkm in the Yangtze River. Our study demonstrated that ART/CRT contributed greatly to the higher Chao-1 index, Shannon-Wiener index, and phylogenetic alpha diversity of benthic bacteria in autumn than in spring. ART showed high overall beta diversity, and CRT/CRAT exhibited more significant distance-decay patterns than ART in both seasons, mainly corresponding to macroscopic landform types. CRT predominated the nonrandom co-occurrence network, with 97% of the keystone species mostly affiliated with Acidobacteriota flourishing in the lower-reach plain. Two selection processes had the greatest influences on the assembly of CRT (74.7-77.6%), whereas CRAT were driven primarily by dispersal limitation (74.9-86.8%) and ART were driven by heterogeneous selection (33.9-48.5%) and undominated stochasticity (32.7-36.5%). Natural factors such as river flow and channel slope exhibited more significant correlations with community variation than nutrients in all three groups, and total organic carbon mediated the balance among the distinct assembly processes of the ART and CRT in both seasons.

Known for its predominant role in the Bacteroidetes phylum, <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> efficiently breaks down poly- and mono-saccharides into beneficial short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), crucial for both host health and microbial ecology balance. Our research focused on how this bacterium's SCFA production differ when utilizing various monosaccharides, with an emphasis on the oxidative stress responses triggered by rhamnose consumption. Notably, rhamnose use results in unique metabolic byproducts, including substantial quantities of 1,2-propanediol, which differs significantly from those produced during glucose metabolism. Our research reveals that rhamnose consumption is associated with a reduction in reactive oxygen species (ROS), signifying improved resistance to oxidative stress compared to other sugars. This effect is attributed to specific gene expressions within the rhamnose metabolic pathway. Notably, overexpression of the rhamnose metabolism regulator RhaR in <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> enhances its survival in oxygen-rich conditions by reducing hydrogen peroxide production. This reduction is linked to decreased expression of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR). In contrast, experiments with a <i>rhaR</i>-deficient strain demonstrated that the absence of RhaR causes <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> cells growing on rhamnose to produce ROS at rates comparable to cells grown on glucose, therefore, losing their advantage in oxidative resistance. Concurrently, the expression of PFOR is no longer suppressed. These results indicate that when <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> is cultured in a rhamnose-based medium, RhaR can restrain the expression of PFOR. Although PFOR is not a primary contributor to intracellular ROS production, its sufficient inhibition does reduce ROS levels to certain extent, consequently improving the bacterium's resistance to oxidative stress.

Thirty rats were divided into 5 groups: Normal (A) and TAA control rats (B) treated orally with daily 10% tween 20; reference rats (C) received daily oral dose of 50\u2009mg/kg silymarin; (D and E) rats received daily doses of 250 and 500\u2009mg/kg MEAL, respectively. In addition, group B-E received 3 injections of 200\u2009mg/kg TAA weekly for 60\u2009days. The phytochemical profiling showed increased polyphenolic (129.2\u2009mg gallic acid equivalent/g) and flavonoid (105.3 mg quercetin equivalent/g extract) contents in MEAL. The TAA intraperitoneal injection caused significant hepatic dysfunctionality (lowered total protein, 54.7\u2009g/L; albumin levels, 7.8\u2009g/L), hepatotoxicity, and necrotized cell proliferation. TAA hepatotoxicity resulted in an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), TGF-\u03b21 tissue expression, liver enzymatic leakage, and oxidative stress biomarkers, while it reduced pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) proteins and inflammatory mediators (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and increased IL-10. Conversely, MEAL treatment ameliorated the TAA-induced hepatotoxicity and restored liver functions. The present hepatoprotectives of MEAL could be attributed to its increased polyphenolic and flavonoid contents, which require further isolation and identification of molecules underlying such therapeutic actions.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "11", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Chemopreventive and Chemotherapeutic Potential of Betulin and Betulinic Acid: Mechanistic Insights From In\u00a0Vitro, In\u00a0Vivo and Clinical Studies.", "article_abstract": "Betulin is a bioactive compound found in large quantities in birch bark and has a triterpene pentacyclic structure. Through the oxidation of betulin, betulinic acid is obtained, which is found in large quantities in nature. Betulin and betulinic acid have multiple pharmacological properties such as antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This comprehensive review aims to deepen the knowledge of the chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects of betulin and betulinic acid by presenting in\u00a0vitro, in\u00a0vivo, and clinical studies evaluating the anticancer mechanisms of betulin, betulinic acid, and their derivatives. The databases searched using specific MESh terms to conduct this review were PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, TRIP database, Wiley, and Scopus. The anticancer properties of betulin and betulinic acid have been reported in a variety of experimental pharmacological studies using different types of cancer cell lines. It has been indicated that induction of apoptosis is the primary anticancer activity of these compounds by selectively affecting cancer cells. As shown by various research, the apoptotic cell death by these compounds is mainly related to factors such as type of cancer and cancer cell line, tumor size, source of betulin/betulinic acid, dose, treatment time, and the type of the drug delivery system employed. Numerous preclinical pharmacological studies and clinical trials on the chemopreventive and antitumour effects of betulin, betulinic acid, and their derivatives have been published.

Intussusception (IS) is the process in which a proximal segment of the bowel invaginates through the lumen of a distal segment. The association between pediatric IS and CD has been described but is still not widely recognized. Herein, we report a case of IS as the first manifestation of CD in a child. A 3-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of marked abdominal distention and lethargy, but there was no history of fever, bleeding per rectum, or jaundice. A second-degree relative had a family history of CD. Clinical examination: The patient was a lethargic child with pale conjunctiva and bilateral lower limb edema. She was a febrile and had a normal hemodynamic status. The adipose tissue was diminished throughout the patient's body; her weight was 8 kg (<5% weight percentile for girls), and her height was 81 cm (<5% height percentile for girls). Laboratory results included the following: Hb of 9 g/dL, serum ferritin of 10 ng/mL (30-400 ng/mL), normal liver function test results except for hypoalbuminemia at 21 g/L (35-52 g/L), and low blood cholesterol of 0.94 g/L (1.54-2.01 g/L). The patient's blood sugar level was 98 mg/dL, and her renal function test results were normal, with negative septic screening. Abdominal radiography revealed several air-fluid levels, suggestive of an obstruction in the small bowel. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed typical features confirming the diagnosis of IS. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated an enteroenteric IS with no other signs of organic causes, such as lymphoma or other tumors. Based on the high index of suspicion of CD, a workup confirmed the diagnosis. A gluten-free diet [A1] was started during the hospital course, and the patient improved dramatically regarding her symptoms and was discharged home.

The physical consequences of delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of SLE are significant. Studies have shown that delays in diagnosis can lead to increased organ damage, poorer health outcomes, and increased morbidity and mortality. With a delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, patients may also experience increased psychological symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and lack of trust in clinicians.

In particular, replicating intricate multiscale hierarchical assembly and functional segregation involved in natural photosystems, such as photosystems I and II, remains particularly demanding within artificial structures. Here, we report the bottom-up construction of a visible-light-driven chemical-biological hybrid nanoreactor with augmented photocatalytic efficiency by anchoring an \u03b1-carboxysome shell encasing [FeFe]-hydrogenases (H-S) on the surface of a hydrogen-bonded organic molecular crystal, a microporous \u03b1-polymorph of 1,3,6,8-tetra(4'-carboxyphenyl)pyrene (TBAP-\u03b1). The self-association of this chemical-biological hybrid system is facilitated by hydrogen bonds, as revealed by molecular dynamics simulations. Within this hybrid photobiocatalyst, TBAP-\u03b1 functions as an antenna for visible-light absorption and exciton generation, supplying electrons for sacrificial hydrogen production by H-S in aqueous solutions. This coordination allows the hybrid nanoreactor, H-S|TBAP-\u03b1, to execute hydrogen evolution exclusively driven by light irradiation with a rate comparable to that of photocatalyst-loaded precious cocatalyst. The established approach to constructing new light-driven biocatalysts combines the synergistic power of biological nanotechnology with the multilength-scale structure and functional control offered by supramolecular organic semiconductors.

Class II lanthipeptide synthetases are bifunctional enzymes responsible for both steps, thus generating macrocyclic natural products. ProcM is part of a group of class II lanthipeptide synthetases that are known for their remarkable substrate tolerance, having large numbers of natural substrates with highly diverse peptide sequences. They install multiple (methyl)lanthionine rings with high accuracy, attributes that have been used to make large libraries of polycyclic peptides. Previous studies suggested that the final ring pattern of the lanthipeptide product may be determined by the substrate sequence rather than by ProcM. The current investigation on the ProcM-catalyzed modification of one of its 30 natural substrates (ProcA3.3) and its sequence variants utilizes kinetic assays to understand the factors that determine the ring pattern. The data show that changes in the substrate sequence result in changes to the reaction rates of ring formation that in some cases lead to a change in the order of the modifications and thereby bring about different ring patterns. These observations provide further support that the substrate sequence determines to a large degree the final ring pattern. The data also show that similar to a previous study on another substrate (ProcA2.8), the reaction rates of successive reactions slow down as the peptide is matured; rate constants observed for the reactions of these two substrates are similar, suggesting that they reflect the intrinsic activity of the enzyme with its 30 natural substrates. We also investigated whether rates of formation of single isolated rings can predict the final ring pattern of polycyclic products, an important question for the products of genome mining exercises, as well as library generation. Collectively, the findings in this study indicate that the rates of isolated modifications can be used for predicting the final ProcM-produced ring pattern, but they also revealed limitations. One unexpected observation was that even changing Ser to Thr and vice versa, a common means to convert lanthionine to methyllanthionine and vice versa, can result in a change in the ring pattern.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "11", "day": "27"}}, {"article_title": "Boron Designer Enzyme with a Hybrid Catalytic Dyad.", "article_abstract": "Genetically encoded noncanonical amino acids can introduce new-to-nature activation modes into enzymes.

We incorporated a boron-containing amino acid into the protein scaffold RamR to create an active enzyme for the kinetic resolution of \u03b1-hydroxythioesters.

Here we illustrate the application of pLCA in a case study of meal options, implementing shared socio-economic pathway scenarios in the LCA background system to represent future production conditions. We assess the climate footprints and land-based biodiversity footprints of a typical meat-based meal in Germany and Indonesia compared to a plant-forward meal in both countries (i.e., four meals), now and in 2050. Our findings show that the plant-forward alternative maintains a lower impact per serving in all future scenarios.

Our findings highlight the importance of supply-side measures to produce lower-impact ingredients, complementing demand-side interventions to reshape food consumption. Results are further evaluated in cultural and nutritional contexts, highlighting the practical decision-making constraints faced by consumers.

In this review, we aim to better describe the inflammatory infiltrates that occur during the course of kidney transplant rejection (active AMR, chronic active AMR and acute and chronic active TCMR). We also discuss minor components of the inflammatory response (mastocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, follicular dendritic cells).

The cause of death is often a result of the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque followed by the discharge of the associated molecular debris into the vessel lumen which occludes the artery leading to ischemia of downstream tissue and to morbidity or mortality of the individual. This is most serious when it occurs in the heart (heart attack) or brain (stroke). Atherosclerotic plaques are classified as either soft, rupture-prone, or hard, rupture resistant. Melatonin, the production of which diminishes with age, has major actions in converting soft to hard plaques. Experimentally, melatonin reduces the ingrowth of capillaries from the tunica media into the plaque relieving pressure on the plaque, reducing intraplaque hemorrhage and limiting the size of the necrotic core. Moreover, melatonin promotes the formation of collagen by invading vascular smooth muscle cells which strengthen the plaque crown making it resistant to rupture. Melatonin is also a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent such that is reduces oxidative damage to tissues associated with the plaque and limits inflammation both of which contribute to plaque cap weakness. Additional benefits of melatonin relative to atherosclerosis is inhibition of adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface, limiting the invasion of monocytes into the arterial intima, and reducing the conversion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages.

An H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus was transmitted into North America from Eurasia in 2021, with the first detection being in Newfoundland and Labrador in Atlantic Canada, and this virus and its reassortants then spread broadly throughout North America and beyond. Following the first 2021 detection, there have been three additional known incursions of Eurasian-origin strains into Atlantic Canada, a second H5N1 strain in 2022 and two H5N5 strains in 2023. In this study, we document a fifth incursion in Atlantic Canada that occurred in 2023 by another H5N5 strain. This strain spread throughout Atlantic Canada and into Quebec, infecting numerous species of wild birds and mammals. Genomic analysis revealed mammalian-adaptive mutations in some of the detected viruses (PB2-E627K and PB2-D701N) and mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes that are associated with enhanced viral fitness and avian transmission capabilities. Our findings indicate that this virus is continuing to circulate in wildlife, and confirms Atlantic Canada is an important North American entry point for Eurasian IAVs. Continued surveillance and genomic analysis of IAVs detected in the region is crucial to monitor the evolution of these viruses and assess potential risks to wildlife and public health.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "17"}}, {"article_title": "Benefits of Intensive Rehabilitation Programs Using Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis-Specific Exercises in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.", "article_abstract": "Purpose Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) affects 3% of adolescents. Physiotherapeutic Scoliosis Specific Exercises (PSSE) are recommended to limit AIS progression, especially within intensive multidisciplinary programs. Our study evaluated the efficiency of these programs\u00a0in AIS cases with a high progression risk. Methods We conducted a controlled retrospective observational study\u00a0using data collected from a multicenter\u00a0cohort that was prospectively collected. One hundred and forty-three major AIS cases with a high progression risk, treated with a corrective brace, were included and divided into two matched groups. In the PSSE group, 72 adolescents followed an intensive 4-week PSSE rehabilitation program; in the control group, 71 adolescents did not follow this program. Patient files were assessed at V0 (inclusion), V1 (6 to 12 months after V0) and V2 (\u2265 6 months after V1). The evaluation criteria were: change in Cobb angle\u00a0and percentage of patients reaching surgical stage at V2. Results At V1, 54.2% of patients in the PSSE group showed improvement compared to 16.9% in the control group (p < 0.001). In contrast, 38.9% of patients in the PSSE group were stabilized, compared to 53.3% in the control group (p = 0.2). At V2, 34.7% of patients in the PSSE group improved compared to\u00a015.5.% in the control group (p <0.006). At V2, 55.6% of patients in the PSSE group were stabilised versus 40.8% in the control group (p < 0.05).

They commonly develop from a background of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), where dysregulated immune responses trigger autoreactive infiltrates and drive clonal B-cell evolution. To understand how these lymphomas and their relapse evolve, we investigated 10 cases by mutation profiling, including five with metachronous lymphomas [primary lymphoma (EMZL\u2009=\u20094, DLBCL\u2009=\u20091) with local relapse (EMZL\u2009=\u20093, DLBCL\u2009=\u20092)], one composite EMZL and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive DLBCL, and four lymphomas (EMZL\u2009=\u20093, FL\u2009=\u20091) with prior or subsequent biopsy showing HT. In four cases with metachronous lymphomas, both common and distinct variants were seen in the paired lesions, indicating their divergent evolution from clonally related lymphoma precursor (CLP) cells. In the remaining case with metachronous lymphomas, the relapsed lesion was progressed from the initial lymphoma. In the case with composite lymphoma, the EBV-positive DLBCL was transformed from EMZL. Finally, in the four cases with paired lymphoma and HT biopsies, two showed shared mutations between the paired lesions, indicating involvement and divergent evolution from CLP cells. Thyroid lymphoma relapse may frequently develop via divergent evolution from a CLP cell, which is likely premalignant. \u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

One marker of these adaptations is decreased baroreflex sensitivity, a strong predictor of post-MI mortality. The relative contributions of cardiac remodelling and neural adaptation in the sensory, central brainstem and peripheral ganglionic loci to baroreflex sensitivity changes remain underexplored. We used a computational model-based approach that accounts for the short-term dynamics of closed-loop human cardiac control to integrate disparate experimental studies on neural adaptation following MI into a unified quantitative framework. We developed an ensemble of 59 distinct model parameterizations that account for the clinically observed heterogeneity of cardiac control in healthy individuals. We simulated an in silico cohort of 35,400 patients with MI, corresponding to six scenarios of one or more loci of neural adaptation coupled with cardiac remodelling. We evaluated the range of MI-induced shifts in arterial pressure, heart rate and baroreflex curve responses. Our results show that adaptation in any single neural locus coupled with cardiac remodelling is sufficient to account for the MI-induced haemodynamic and autonomic changes observed experimentally. Of the adaptation pathways, we found that individuals with central or peripheral vagal efferent adaptation and preserved baroreceptor gain could maintain high baroreflex sensitivity after ischaemic injury. These results suggest that there are a multitude of adaptive pathways for tuning the baroreflex circuit to shift cardiac control physiology, potentially explaining patient heterogeneity post-MI. KEY POINTS: Baroreflex sensitivity is a strong indicator of post-myocardial ischaemia survival and is variable among individuals. We fine-tuned a computational model ensemble based on physiological observations to develop an in silico patient cohort consistent with the range of baroreflex responses observed experimentally. Simulation and analysis of the in silico cohort show that individuals with a functional afferent pathway and the ability to adapt along the vagal efferent pathway can maintain baroreflex sensitivity post-cardiac ischaemia.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "Mechanistic Learning for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.", "article_abstract": "We employed a mechanistic learning approach, integrating on-treatment tumor kinetics (TK) modeling with various machine learning (ML) models to address the challenge of predicting post-progression survival (PPS)-the duration from the time of documented disease progression to death-and overall survival (OS) in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC).

Electrostatic interactions depend strongly on the variant since the charge of the Spike protein (responsible for virus-environment interactions) evolved across the variants from the highly negative Wild Type (WT) to the highly positive Omicron variant. The distribution of the charge also evolved from diffuse to highly localized. These facts suggest that SARS-CoV-2 should interact strongly with charged surfaces in a way that changed during the virus evolution. This question is studied here by computing the electrostatic interaction between WT, Delta and Omicron Spike proteins with charged surfaces using a new method (based on Debye-H\u00fcckel theory) that provides efficiently general results as a function of the surface charge density \u03c3. We found that the interaction of the WT and Delta variant spikes with charged surfaces is dominated by repulsive image forces proportional to \u03c3<sup>2</sup> originating at the protein/water interface.

In case of cytisine, suspension type patches were often formed and only in some patches sufficient adhesiveness was retained. Adhesion of silicone based matrices was altered profoundly by the simultaneous drug and excipient addition. Only one matrix with indomethacin and silicone oil showed acceptable quality in both tack and peel tests (S1, Bio-PSA MD7-4502). In the course of the data analysis of the adhesiveness, the relevance of film formation mechanism was noted. It was observed, that if the film formation occurs by solvent evaporation in patches where drug particles are suspended, the impact of the particles on adhesion might be greater than in the case of patches with the dissolved drug. It was concluded, that a choice of a suitable polymer-liquid mixture for a particular active substance requires an experimental work in case of an adhesive properties adjustment.

The current study evaluated the long-term effects of treatment with risperidone or olanzapine on body weight, caloric intake, serum insulin, blood glucose, and metabolism-associated gene expression in C57Bl/6J female mice. Compared to mice treated with vehicle, female mice treated with risperidone or olanzapine gained weight at higher rates during treatment and maintained higher body weights for months following treatment cessation. High-fat diet feeding did not produce a robust difference in weight gain in previously treated vs. control groups. Finally, female mice previously treated with olanzapine also exhibited increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and lipogenesis. These findings suggest that pediatric use of SGA medications that induce excess weight gain during treatment may exert persistent effects on body weight and gene expression and such outcomes may form an important aspect of assessing risk-to-benefit ratios in prescribing decisions.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "24"}}, {"article_title": "Exploring the Unique Role of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators in Cancer Therapeutics.", "article_abstract": "Unresolved chronic inflammation, a hallmark of cancer, promotes tumor growth and metastasis in various cancer types. In contrast to blocking inflammation, stimulation of resolution of inflammation is an entirely novel approach to \"resolve\" inflammation. Resolution of inflammation mechanisms in cancer includes clearance of tumor debris, counter-regulation of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines, and suppression of leukocyte infiltration. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, anti-angiogenic therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors directly or indirectly can lead to the generation of pro-tumorigenic cellular debris. Over the past two decades, a potential paradigm shift has emerged in the inflammation field with the discovery of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), including resolvins, lipoxins, maresins, and protectins. SPMs are structurally distinct families of mediators grouped together by their pro-resolving \"debris-clearing\" functions. \"Pro-resolving\" therapies are in clinical development for various inflammation-driven diseases, including cancer. SPMs, as novel cancer therapeutics, have tremendous potential to enhance current cancer therapy.

This work represents the first study to fabricate a novel triangular lignin photonic crystal nanoparticle via a green technique that combines solvent shifting and acid precipitation. This new model system has successfully produced LNPs with different structural architectures, ranging from spherical shapes to triangular plates. The structural transformation and formation mechanism of LNPs were investigated through various techniques. The nanotriangles grow depending on the employed solvents with dialysis, which involve controlled nucleation, Ostwald ripening-driven growth, particle coalescence, and geometric optimization. The isolated LNPs displayed excellent hydrophobic properties and remarkable UV-blocking efficiency. Furthermore, they preserved nearly the same zeta potential in aqueous suspensions over 6\u00a0months of storage, which is considered highly stable for colloidal systems.

However, whether the ANXA2 protein interacts with the picornavirus 3C protein to regulate viral infection and its effect on type I interferon (IFN) has not been reported.

Here we investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of P. murinus infections in 1131 bat flies collected from seven European bat species, focusing on Basilia nana, collected from its primary host, the Bechstein's bat throughout its distribution. Additionally, we explore the temporal dynamics of P. murinus in two regions in Germany where bat flies were repeatedly collected over at least five years. Bat flies were screened for Polychromophilus infection via PCR of a fragment of cytochrome b, and fragments of three additional genes were sequenced for positive samples. Overall, P. murinus infections were detected in 287 of 1131 screened bat flies of four different species, collected from seven bat species, across 13 countries. The 269 recovered cytb sequences represented 21 distinct haplotypes, clustered based on the bat species from which the infected flies were collected. Repeated sampling over multiple years revealed a consistent presence of P. murinus in both investigated populations, without substantial variation in prevalence between years. The results suggest an endemic long-term presence of Polychromophilus within European bat populations, and the presence of host-specific associations between P. murinus lineages and its various bat hosts.

It assesses the efficacy of different needle designs and maneuvers, including suction techniques and needle passes. Moreover, the diverse tissue preparation methods, including cytological smear, cell block, and direct histology, are discussed, highlighting the importance of tailored approaches based on tumor characteristics. Additionally, the roles of macroscopic on-site evaluation and rapid on-site evaluation in optimizing specimen adequacy are investigated. Furthermore, percutaneous ultrasound-guided biopsy is considered an alternative approach, particularly in settings where EUS is impractical. Additionally, the review emphasizes the emerging trend of using tissue for genetic testing and molecular analysis, requiring high-quality sample acquisition.

Current wood nutrient dynamics models are extensions of those developed for leaf litter decomposition. However, tissue structure and dominant decomposers differ between leaf and woody litter, and recent evidence suggests that decomposer stoichiometry, in combination with litter quality, may affect nutrient release. We quantified decomposition and release of C and nutrients from woody litter for two stem sizes of 22 tree species in a P-limited temperate forest near Sydney, Australia, and compared these to estimates from leaf litter literature. Following theory, N and P accumulated during early decomposition, but began to decline earlier than expected based on work in leaves.

C\u2009:\u2009N at which N was released was higher in larger stems (c. 124) than in smaller stems (c. 82), both being higher than in leaf litter. Drawing from the literature, these differences in N and P dynamics may be due to the identity of wood decomposers. C\u2009:\u2009N of wood decomposers is higher than the mean C\u2009:\u2009N of leaf litter decomposers, and this difference in stoichiometry may have important flow-on effects for nutrient cycles in forests.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "Disturbed spatial WNT activation - a potential driver of the reticularized skin phenotype in Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).", "article_abstract": "Little is known on the mechanisms necessary to maintain the physiological adult human skin integrity.

This process is thought to initiate by protein adsorption, which enables immune cells to attach and mount an inflammatory response. Previously, several antifibrotic materials have been either designed to reduce protein adsorption or discovered via high-throughput screens (HTS) to favorably regulate inflammation. The present work introduces antifouling immunomodulatory (AIM) copolymer coatings, which combine both strategies to effectively enhance\u00a0implant protection. AIM copolymers synergistically integrate zwitterionic moieties to resist protein fouling, HTS-derived antifibrotics for immunomodulation, and silane monomers for grafting to diverse substrates including elastomers, ceramics, and metals. Interestingly, simply combining these monomers into conventional random or block copolymer architectures yielded no significant advantage over homopolymers. By contrast, an unusual polymer chain architecture - a zwitterionic block flanked by a mixed zwitterionic immunomodulatory segment - showed superior fibrosis resistance in both peritoneal and subcutaneous sites over one month in immunocompetent mice. This architecture also improved the performance of two different HTS-derived antifibrotic monomers, suggesting that tailoring AIM architectures may broadly complement immunomodulatory chemistries and provide a versatile approach to improving implant longevity.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "Barriers and Facilitators to the Participation of Pregnant Women in Clinical Research: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review.", "article_abstract": "Pregnant women had a large demand for diagnosis and treatment, but the clinical research was not sufficient, and there were many barriers for pregnant women to participate in clinical research.

According to recent studies, a number of neoplastic disorders and ferroptosis are intimately connected. This study aims to identify the role of key ferroptosis-related gene (protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 2, PRKAA2) and explore new directions for the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. The PRKAA2 expression and its influence on survival were analyzed in multiple public databases (TCGA, TIMER2.0, and GEPIA). And PRKAA2 mRNA level in NSCLC cells were examined by qRT-PCR. Silencing of PRKAA2 (sh-PRKAA2) were used to cell transfection. CCK-8, EdU, and flow cytometry assays were used to measure cell proliferation and apoptosis. The protein levels of ferroptosis markers (SLC7A11, GPX4, and NRF2) were determined by western blotting. Meanwhile, the related ferroptosis analysis, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), iron, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> levels were also detected in the transfected cells. Moreover, the relationship between PRKAA2 expression and SLC7A11 was analyzed. NSCLC xenograft mouse models were used for in vivo verification of the PRKAA2 function. Here, our data revealed that PRKAA2 was upregulated in NSCLC cells. Additionally, PRKAA2 strengthened cell proliferation and attenuated apoptosis and ferroptosis of NSCLC cells. The depletion of PRKAA2 enhanced the erastin-induced inhibition effect on cell growth, and notably increased the levels of MDA, ROS, iron, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>, while decreased GSH level in NSCLC cells. In the mechanism exploration, we discovered that PRKAA2 could activate the SLC7A11/GSH/GPx4 antioxidant pathway. The rescue experiments showed that SLC7A11 abrogated the inhibitive impacts of PRKAA2 repression on cellular proliferation, cell apoptosis, and ferroptosis in NSCLC. Besides, animal experiments proved that PRKAA2 enhanced NSCLC tumor growth in vivo.

Our previous study shows that targeting the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) to inhibit macrophage inflammation may be a promising strategy for ALF treatment. however, the mechanism by which PKM2 regulates the inflammatory response is unclear. Here we demonstrate that PKM2 contributes to ALF by modulating NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis activation in liver macrophages. The specific knockout of PKM2 in myeloid cells reduces mortality and alleviates hepatic injury in D-galactosamine/LPS-induced ALF mice. Single-cell transcriptome analysis suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation of macrophages involves in ALF, knockout of PKM2 in macrophages reduces the expression of NLRP3, and activation of pyroptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of the PKM2 nuclear translocation, but not glycolytic activity, protects mice from ALF. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PKM2 attenuates NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis activation and consequently reduces the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 by macrophages. Mechanistically, PKM2 translocates into the nucleus and combines with STAT3, enhancing its phosphorylation and recruitment to the NLRP3 promoter region, thereby increasing NLRP3 expression.

The local effects of such populations deemed to be in outbreak are currently poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the localised feeding behaviours of Acanthaster sp. within an outbreak population, so as to better understand the reefs vulnerable to future outbreaks. Data was collected over a 2-year period, using underwater visual census methods. Survey parameters included sea star abundance, as well as substrate composition and frequency of observed predation scarring. Acanthaster sp. populations were observed to consistently exceed regional outbreak definitions (34.4 individuals ha<sup>-1</sup>), and demonstrated unimodal size distribution consistent with a primary outbreak. Analysis of feeding behaviour displayed some evidence to support previous claims of density-dependent predation within Acanthaster sp. populations. Van der Ploeg and Scavia tests of dietary preference appeared to suggest that Acanthaster sp. have a marked preference for coral morphologies belonging to tabular and arborescent coral types, and a strong avoidance for massive, laminar, submassive, and solitary coral morphs. Furthermore, Acanthaster sp. displayed a preference towards small coral colonies between 0 and 20\u00a0cm. This finding has potential significance for reef resilience and diversity within areas at risk of CoT outbreaks, and seemingly opposes previous literature in other regions.

These lesions, typically asymptomatic, necessitate precise imaging modalities to characterize their nature and determine subsequent clinical actions, such as follow-up imaging, biopsy, or surgical referral. The anatomic location of these cystic lesions, whether biliary or peribiliary, influences both diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Biliary cystic lesions, such as mucinous cystic neoplasms, intraductal papillary neoplasms of the bile duct, and Caroli disease, require careful monitoring due to their propensity to develop malignancy. In contrast, peribiliary cysts are often associated with chronic liver disease and may indicate disease progression through a gradual increase in cyst size. Accurate differentiation of these lesions from other clinical entities that have overlapping features on imaging, such as microabscesses, bilomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, neurofibromatosis, and vascular anomalies such as cavernous transformation of the portal vein, is essential given the divergent management for each.

Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical properties of defective MOFs becomes important for the defect engineering in MOFs. Herein, using the in situ compression tests, we directly observe very different mechanical responses in HKUST-1 MOFs with various defect concentrations. The elastic-plastic deformation followed by a ductile flattened failure is found in the defective HKUST-1 with a small defect concentration, while a hyperelastic-plastic behavior accompanied by the brittle fracture failure could occur in the HKUST-1 with a large defect concentration. The strong dependence of deformation and failure behaviors of defective HKUST-1 crystals on the defect concentration is ascribed to the change in their local deformation mechanism and stress distribution with varying defect concentration, according to the analysis by finite element and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our compression experiments and MD simulations also indicate a significant reduction in both Young's modulus and yield strength of HKUST-1 with growing defect concentration, which agrees well with the theoretical predictions of micromechanics theory.

Herein, the FI is defined as meat fluorescence, which has a strong correlation with the bacterial density. Combined with ML techniques, hyperspectral data are processed more efficiently. By employing linear discriminant and quadratic component analyses, the FI can be estimated from its decision boundary after hyperspectral data are obtained in an unknown freshness state.

Advanced imaging techniques, such as diffusion MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), offer insights into structural and functional changes within olfactory pathways. This review summarizes a decade of research on MRI-based connectivity of the olfactory system in PD, focusing on structural and functional alterations in olfactory brain areas and their links to early olfactory processing changes. Fifteen dMRI and eighteen fMRI studies met inclusion criteria and were carefully reviewed. Among the studies investigating diffusion metrics, the most consistent finding was the reduction of fractional anisotropy in the olfactory tract and anterior olfactory structures, though evidence correlating this result to olfactory dysfunction is limited and contrasting. dMRI support the hypothesis that olfactory function may be correlated to structural alterations at the network-level. In contrast, fMRI studies found more consistent evidence of dysconnectivity in both primary and secondary olfactory areas as directly correlated to olfactory processing and dysfunction. Results suggest a potential dissociation between structural alterations in olfactory brain regions and early functional impairment in olfactory processing, likely related to different patient subtypes. Heterogeneity in clinical and technical factors may limit the generalizability of the results, leaving room for further investigations. By providing a comprehensive perspective on the use of dMRI and fMRI to explore the olfactory connectome in PD, our review might facilitate future research towards earlier diagnosis and more targeted therapeutic and neurorehabilitation strategies.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "15"}}, {"article_title": "Harnessing nanoengineered CAR-T cell strategies to advance solid tumor immunotherapy.", "article_abstract": "The efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is still inconclusive in solid tumor treatment.

Data series on spurdog movement and habitat use have been somewhat limited to research surveys due to challenges associated with electronic tagging. Here, we offer a revised attachment method for externally attached pop-up satellite archival tags that was successful in long-term deployments on pregnant females. Twenty-one spurdogs were tagged in two fjord systems in western Norway for an average of 243\u2009days and provided new details about their behaviour, demonstrating affinity for coastal habitat based on the pop-up locations and recovery positions of the tags (84% within 40\u2009km from tagging location), and depth-temperature profiles. It is likely that parturition therefore occurs in these coastal waters, making them important to the life cycle of this species. The realized depth niche of tagged individuals suggested that surveys may miss sharks if they do not cover the full water column because the sharks used large parts of the water column and spent much time in shallower waters, albeit with seasonal variations (deeper and shallower in winter and summer, respectively). Adoption of this tagging method and combination with movement data from acoustic transmitters will help to better resolve the behaviour of this species as it transitions from a species at risk to a managed fishery.

The current study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary energy during the last 6\u00a0weeks prepartum on the energy metabolism dynamic responses and the newborn lamb metabolic profile in prolific ewes. Forty-five crossbred (Dorset\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Romanov) ewes were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary energy densities: E<sub>CTRL</sub>: 8.36\u00a0MJ of metabolizable energy (ME)/kg DM for weeks -6 to -3 relative to lambing, followed by 10.01\u00a0MJ ME/kg DM for weeks -2 and -1; E<sub>INCR</sub>: weekly increments from 7.99 to 12.69\u00a0MJ ME/kg DM; and E<sub>HIGH</sub>: 10.87\u00a0MJ ME/kg DM for the last 6\u00a0weeks of gestation. Dry matter intake (DMI; daily) and energy intake (MEI; daily), blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and glucose (every other day), as well as plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs; weekly), BW and body condition score (BCS; twice weekly) were determined throughout the experimental period. The effect of time on DMI and MEI varied based on dietary energy densities and litter size. During the last week before lambing, DMI decreased for E<sub>HIGH</sub> and E<sub>INCR</sub> ewes, as well as for ewes carrying quadruplets. On average, during week -5 to week -2 of gestation, E<sub>HIGH</sub> promoted the highest DMI and MEI, resulting in an increase of 0.16 BCS points between the pretreatment week and week -1 prepartum. In contrast, during the same period, BCS of E<sub>CTRL</sub> and E<sub>INCR</sub> ewes decreased by 0.35 and 0.19 points, respectively, which was reflected by higher NEFA concentrations compared with E<sub>HIGH</sub> ewes. The greater litter size was also associated with decreased BCS. Compared with twin-bearing ewes, for which BCS remained stable, BCS decreased for triplet-, and even more intensively for quadruplet-bearing ewes. Consequently, plasma NEFA concentrations were higher for quadruplet-bearing ewes than for twin- and triplet-bearing ewes, especially during the last week prepartum. Blood BHB concentrations increased from 0.63 to 1.13\u00a0mM over time. Regardless of dietary treatments, in the last week prepartum, blood BHB concentrations increased for quadruplet-bearing ewes, being 2.6 and 2.2 times greater than for twin- and triplet-bearing ewes, respectively.

Our findings demonstrated that MNB ozonation achieved a 99.0 % removal efficiency of IBU within 70 min, significantly surpassing the 69.8 % efficiency observed with conventional ozonation under optimal conditions. Both conventional and MNB ozonation primarily transformed IBU through oxidation processes, including hydroxylation and the conversion of CH bonds to C = O groups, along with carbon cleavage. However, MNB ozonation markedly reduced the toxicity of IBU-laden wastewater by further transforming toxic by-products, particularly under mildly alkaline conditions (pH 7.2 and 9.0). This reduction in toxicity led to a significant improvement in subsequent AD performance; specifically, a 70-min MNB ozonation pretreatment enhanced methane production by 48.1 %, increased chemical oxygen demand removal by 35.6 %, and reduced fatty acid accumulation compared to the control without pretreatment. Additionally, the effluent from MNB ozonation positively impacted the microbial community, particularly by enriching syntrophic bacteria and methanogens. Overall, these findings offered new insights into the behavior and toxicity of IBU oxidation by-products in both conventional and MNB ozonation processes.

Specifically, the HT-induced ferroptosis could be supported by both the growth and physiological indicators. These include the suppressed growth (76.05 %), suppressed nutrient removals (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N by 76.22 %, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>-P by 64.15 %), accumulated intracellular Fe<sup>3+</sup> concentrations (7.75-fold), enhanced oxidative stress (e.g., increased levels of reactive oxygen species (159.97 %)), activated antioxidant defense system (e.g., increased activities of superoxide dismutase (24.83 %) and catalase (5.03-fold)), and obvious membrane damage (e.g., increased levels of malondialdehyde (1.67-fold)). Further metabolomic analysis indicated that such HT-induced ferroptosis was also largely related to the significant alternations of lipid remodeling in three aspects: varied abundance of certain lipids specific to chloroplast membrane or mitochondria, accumulation of certain lipids with lower unsaturation, and formation of lipid peroxides disrupting membrane integrity. Moreover, the key genes involved in ferroptosis correspondingly responded, especially those associated with lipid metabolism (e.g., ACSL), antioxidant defense system (e.g., GSS, GPX and GSR), mitochondrial normal functioning (e.g., SEL1L), autophagy regulation (e.g., ATG9, ATG11, ATG13) and protein folding (e.g., HSPA5, HSPA1s, HSP90B).

According to the results, the modified PA with powder activated carbon (PAC) could successfully reduce the level of total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oil and grease to below the DW standards but failed to efficiently remove some heavy metals (HMs) and nutrient pollutants. The results revealed that the treated stormwater was an appropriate medium for microalgae cultivation. Chlorella sorokiniana cultivation in the treated stormwater reduced the concentration of HMs and nutrients to below the DW standard: Cr = 9.45 \u03bcg/L, Pb = 0.17 \u03bcg/L, Cd = 0.003 \u03bcg/L, COD = 1.18 mg/L, total nitrogen (TN) = 0.04 mg/L and total phosphate (TP) = 0.006 mg/L. In addition, microalgae could completely consume CO<sub>2</sub> and increase dissolved oxygen (DO) when different concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> (natural air, traffic air and tunnel with and without ventilation) were injected into the culture medium.

A critical research gap, however, remains in the effective incorporation of WDN hydraulic characteristics in machine learning. Here we present a new water distribution network embedding (WDNE) method that transforms the hydraulic relationships of WDN topology into a vector form to be best suited for machine learning algorithms. The nodal relationships are characterized by local structure, global structure and attribute information. A conjoint use of two deep auto-encoder embedding models ensures that the hydraulic relationships and attribute information are simultaneously preserved and are effectively utilized by machine learning models. WDNE provides a new way to bridge WDN hydraulics with machine learning. It is first applied to a pipe burst localization problem. The results show that it can increase the performance of machine learning algorithms, and enable a lightweight machine learning algorithm to achieve better accuracy with less training data compared with a deep learning method reported in the literature. Then, applications in node grouping problems show that WDNE enables machine learning algorithms to make use of WDN hydraulic information, and integrates WDN structural relationships to achieve better grouping results.

Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) represents a crucial component of carbon storage in seagrass ecosystems, with refractory DOC (RDOC) playing a key role in long-term (millennial time scale) carbon stocks. The processes governing RDOC are heavily influenced by microbial activity. While it is known that nutrient loading can weaken DOC sequestration potential by changing the DOC composition and transformation, the impact of nutrients on microbial communities that regulate the RDOC pool in seagrass ecosystems remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we conducted a 300-d laboratory incubation experiment to examine the effects of nutrient enrichment on DOC processing and microbial community dynamics. As expected, nutrient addition significantly accelerated the decline in DOC concentration, resulting in the residual DOC exhibiting a higher degree of humification and more depleted \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C constituents. Concurrent with DOC degradation, microbial community composition shifted from a mix of r- and K-strategists in the early stages to a dominance of K-strategists and fungi in the later stages. Specific bacterial taxa, such as unidentified Rhodospirillales and Oceanococcus, were more prevalent in eutrophicated seagrass waters, while Magnetospira and Nocardioide were more abundant in less eutrophicated waters by the end of the incubation. We speculated that these microbial groups likely adapted to utilise more RDOC, contributing to its decline. The decline in RDOC was approximately 2-times greater in less eutrophicated seagrass waters compared to more eutrophicated waters (26.9 % and 14.5 % decline respectively), which suggests that less eutrophicated seagrass ecosystems are more vulnerable.

Here, for the first time, we review the levels of contamination of chars produced from pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) with dl-PCB congeners. We conduct a detailed and critical examination of the role played by the processing parameters, such as temperature and residence time, and the reaction mechanisms, to detoxify the biomass under an oxygen-free atmosphere during its valorisation. The PCB-based toxicity of biomass depends mostly on the abundance of dl-PCB in the raw material, and on the dechlorination and other transformation processes that operate during the treatment. The key dechlorination steps make the toxicity of hydrochars pass through a maximum with increasing treatment time, whereas the toxicity of biochars in pyrolysis decreases monotonically. Pyrolysis displays more complex mechanistic pathways of volatilisation, dechlorination, degradation of PCB rings, minor de novo formation of dl-PCB in case of air leaks, and concentrating persistent organic pollutants (POP) in char matrices. In contrast, the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of toxicity in HTC processes comprise the dechlorination, possible chlorine position shift, and biomass densification. The kinetic model developed in this review affords insight into the evolution of the hydrochar toxicity that depends on process temperature and treatment time. The dl-PCB concentrations in treated biomass generally range from 1.06\u00a0ng WHO<sub>2005</sub>-TEQ (kg DM)<sup>-1</sup> to 11.7\u00a0ng WHO<sub>2005</sub>-TEQ (kg DM)<sup>-1</sup>, whereas for biochars produced from contaminated sediments the toxicity varies from 0.00662\u00a0ng WHO<sub>1998</sub>-TEQ (kg DM)<sup>-1</sup> to 1.42\u00a0ng WHO<sub>1998</sub>-TEQ (kg DM)<sup>-1</sup>.

All mice were tested in adulthood for the acute effect of the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, on PPI. Apomorphine treatment reduced PPI in intact mice and this effect was blocked after OVX in adulthood. A low dose implant of 17\u03b2-estradiol prevented this OVX effect and reinstated apomorphine-induced PPI disruption. Following adolescent OVX, the effect of apomorphine was not altered and it significantly reduced PPI in adulthood. A low dose implant of 17\u03b2-estradiol following adolescent OVX effect blocked apomorphine-induced PPI disruption in adulthood. Apomorphine had no effect on PPI in any of the mice treated with the high dose of 17\u03b2-estradiol or a combination of low-dose 17\u03b2-estradiol and progesterone, irrespective of treatment age, suggesting an antipsychotic action.

The results showed that the generation of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with the addition of BF greatly optimized the impedance matching of the CIP.

In this study, we identified the expression pattern of AtBCCP2 under various stress conditions, including 4\u00a0mM NaHCO\u2083, 2\u00a0mM Na\u2082CO\u2083, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 300\u00a0mM D-mannitol, 100\u00a0\u03bcM ABA, 5\u00a0mM\u00a0H\u2082O\u2082, 4\u00a0\u00b0C, and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. It was determined that AtBCCP2 is positively regulated by NaHCO\u2083, Na\u2082CO\u2083, NaCl, and ABA, but negatively regulated by D-mannitol. Phenotypic experiment confirmed that the AtBCCP2 transgenic overexpression plants exhibited increased resistance to NaHCO\u2083, Na\u2082CO\u2083, NaCl, and ABA stresses, but more sensitive to drought stress simulated by D-mannitol. In contrast, mutant plants showed the opposite phenotypes. Additionally, AtBCCP2 transgenic overexpression plants demonstrated stronger antioxidant activity and lower MDA content under stresses such as NaHCO\u2083, Na\u2082CO\u2083, NaCl, and ABA, in contrast to the mutant plants. In response to D-mannitol simulated drought stress, AtBCCP2 transgenic overexpression plants showed lower antioxidant activity and higher MDA content, while mutant plants exhibited the opposite trend. In conclusion, this study provides a theoretical basis for understanding the role of AtBCCP2 in response to multiple stresses and contributes a new gene to the pool of those involved in abiotic stress responses.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "21"}}, {"article_title": "Sustained improvements in sick leave, fatigue and functional status following a concentrated micro-choice based treatment for patients with long COVID: A 1 year prospective uncontrolled study.", "article_abstract": "Long COVID has affected approximately 200 million people globally, with substantial consequences for the individuals, healthcare systems and society.

Both parties assume that the arrow of explanation at issue involves a claim of fundamentality and priority of one of the elements over the other. I challenge this assumption, and I propose a third way to understand the connection. Drawing a lesson from Herman von Helmholtz's and David Hilbert's views on the foundations of geometry, I argue that in spacetime theories chronogeometry and dynamics are inextricably interconnected counterparts, so claims of fundamental explanation and priority, regardless of the direction of the alleged arrow, are misconceptions.

Taken together, thevinols and orvinols constitute an important family of opioid receptor (OR) ligands playing an important role in both the OR mediated antinociception and OR antagonism. Herein, we disclose for the first time the antagonist activity of the N-allyl substituted orvinol derivative fluorinated within the pharmacophore associated with C(20) and its surrounding. This compound was prepared via a novel synthetic sequence from 18,19-dihydrothevinone bearing an allyl substituent at N(17) and three fluorine atoms at C(21). Preliminary trials reported earlier demonstrated that the compound exhibited no analgesic activity. However, in vivo experiments conducted in an acute pain model (tail-flick test in mice) demonstrated that this fluorinated compound, when administered at doses of 5-10\u00a0mg/kg (sc) 30\u00a0min before morphine, exhibited antagonistic activity at the level of naloxone (1\u00a0mg/kg, sc) for a longer duration (at least 120\u00a0min) compared to naloxone (60\u00a0min). Together with the analgesic activity that has been reported for the C(21)-trifluorinated relatives bearing methyl or cyclopropylmethyl substituent at N(17), this result highlights C(21)-fluorinated thevinols and orvinols as the family of opioid receptor ligands (structurally related to buprenorphine, diprenorphine, etc.) covering the full range of activity profiles from agonists to antagonists, which is promising for tuning of their pharmacological properties via a substitution of hydrogen atoms within the pharmacophore associated with C(20) and its surrounding for fluorine.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "18"}}, {"article_title": "Olfactory cleft brushing: A minimally invasive tool for biomarker analysis in rhinology.", "article_abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a prevalent condition associated with post-viral syndromes, chronic rhinosinusitis, and neurodegenerative diseases.

A total of 112 deer brain samples underwent testing using a universal testing machine after one freeze-thaw cycle. These samples were obtained from eight different brain regions. During sample preparation, 7 out of all samples failed. Among the 105 tests, 89 (85%) were successful.

While these manipulations resulted in variations from the true surface structure, they could be explained by an affine transformation. This suggests that the perception of the intrinsic 3D shape of faces is stable across these image manipulation techniques.

Samples were collected directly from the fishermen at the landing sites of the study area between October and December 2022. The levels of metal accumulation in different seafood were statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Mollusks had the highest average concentrations, followed by fish and crustaceans. In some seafood species, concentrations exceeded the level of \"Food Safety Guidelines of WHO/FAO\". Feeding habits and/or local pollution sources mainly contribute to the bioavailability and accumulation of heavy metals in seafood.

Using a species of Parabathynellidae (Crustacea, Bathynellacea) from groundwater as a case study, we found sample preparation for cryo-FESEM to be relatively rapid and minimal compared with traditional preparation methods.

Experimental characterization and theoretical calculation results reveal that incorporating single-atom Mn and HDMP into CN alters the charge density distribution on the heptazine rings. This modification enhances the absorption of visible light and reduces exciton binding energy, leading to improved separation and migration of photogenerated charge carriers. Moreover, the single-atom Mn provides abundant active sites for O<sub>3</sub> adsorption and activation, which increases the utilization of photogenerated electrons to produce highly reactive oxidative species. Consequently, CN-MA exhibits superior photocatalytic ozonation activity, achieving 94% mineralization of phenol within 60\u00a0min and maintaining excellent stability over multiple cycles.

We employed total internal reflection microscopy and particle tracking to measure the microcapsule-boundary interactions and diffusion, from which potential energy and diffusivity profiles were derived. The potential energy profile characterizing the normal interaction was analyzed and simulated by considering electrostatic, gravitational, van der Waals, and tethered forces, while the lateral diffusivity was compared to that of a solid particle-boundary interaction, inclusive of hydrodynamic forces. The diffusivity was represented as a normalized diffusion coefficient to eliminate the impact of fluid viscosity.

Suppressed glycolysis leads to a decrease in insoluble ECM, primarily due to the inhibition of ECM-modifying enzyme activity and a decrease in glycine synthesis. Notably, promoted FAO facilitates the intracellular degradation pathway of ECM. In addition, the findings revealed that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) serves as a crucial metabolic regulator in the transition from FAO to glycolysis, thereby playing a significant role in ECM deposition in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Further, the promotion of FAO, inhibition of glycolysis and HIF-1\u03b1 reduce ECM production and promote ECM degradation, ultimately impeding the progression of fibrosis and providing therapeutic relief for established pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. These findings unveil the metabolic rewire underpinning the deposition of ECM in silica-induced lung fibrosis and identify novel targets for promoting regression of pulmonary fibrosis.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}, {"article_title": "The Current Advances in Design Strategy (Indirect Strategy and Direct Strategy) for Type-I Photosensitizers.", "article_abstract": "Type-I photosensitizers (PSs) are among the most potential candidates for photodynamic therapy (PDT), as their low dependence on oxygen endow them with many advantages for treating hypoxic tumor. However, most of the reported type-I PSs have a contingency of molecular design, because electron transfer (ET) reaction is more difficult to achieve than energy transfer (EET) process. Therefore, it is urgent to understand molecular design mechanisms for type-I PSs. In this review, the two ways to achieve the type-I PSs, i.e., inhibiting EET process (type-II) or enhancing ET process (type-I), are detailly explained. In response, the current design strategies of type-I PSs are summarized from two perspectives: indirect strategy (inhibiting EET process: reducing the energy of the lowest triplet excited state (T<sub>1</sub>) to lower than the energy required for the excitation energy transfer to produce singlet oxygen) and direct strategy (enhancing ET process: promoting the ET efficiency of PSs to generate superoxide radicals). The construction of direct strategy can be realized by forming an electron-rich microenvironment, providing an electron-deficient intermediate transmitter, and introducing an enhanced electron transfer capacity primitive.", "pub_date": {"year": "2024", "month": "12", "day": "25"}}]
